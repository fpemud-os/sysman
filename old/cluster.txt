fully manage: BIOS, bootloader, initramfs, kernel, rootfs

how to update:
   1. update when controller is update itself, compile in controller
   2. initramfs, kernel, rootfs is stored in controller and send to all slaves.



for fpemud-os-cluster:
*. every slave has an agent daemon?
*. initramfs and squashfs is the slave's rootfs, modules is used for slave's kernel
*. no nfs is used. slave can have it's own hdd to save persistent data, if no hdd is on slave, slave store data in tmpfs.
   slave's hdd is not used to save system files.
*. slave should be rebooted for any update on rootfs
*. every slave has pxe server, tftp server. slaves advertise themself through dns-sd. master has no deemon
*. dhcp server is on router or wrtd, not provide by fpemud-os-cluster.
*. master can be temporarily be pxe server and tftp server in the foreground by run a command, this has higher priority than slaves
*. when update, master will send all images to all slaves.
*. one kernel and image for one cpu-arch.
*. a configure modify engine to replace variables in configure file for each node.
*. run app though ssh (or ansible?)?
*. internet access for slave is done by router or wrtd, not provide by fpemud-os-cluster.
*. slave does have a system hdd, so that it can boot with no daemon on master. but when boot failure, it will do pxe boot, so that it can get the newest image.
